# Glossary

**Polymorphism** means to take more than one form and is an important feature in object oriented programming that is used to implement inheritance. One helpful way to think about it is in real life, in that we, as “objects” take on many forms depending on context: student, friend, daughter, sister, etc. but we’re still just one “object.”

In OOP, a developer can have variables, objects or functions that belong to one base class, and these variables, objects and function can then have subclasses that inherit methods from the parent but with different behaviors. A good example is that of a base class of Animals that has subclasses of horse, bird and fish. Each of the subclasses can inherit the move() method but each will implement the move() method differently.
